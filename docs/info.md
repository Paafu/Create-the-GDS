## How it works

if input is 1 sum = 1, acarry = 0
if both inputs are 1 sum = 0, Carry = 1

xor gate one leg gets input form a other from b same for the and gate and we gat 1 sum ou and carry out

## How to test

input a and b | output and | output xor 
0 0              0            0
0 1              0            1
1 0              0            1
